With the same network traffic analysis as Snort...

------------------------- Storage COVERT CHANNEL -----------------

Using the TTL more than once is possible in Suricata:

alert ip any any -> any any (msg:"IP Time To Live Field Contain Unfamiliar Data... May Be Contain Covert Channel!"; ttl:65; ttl:66; ttl:67; ip_proto:6; classtype:misc-activity; sid:2101321;)

While the Suricata system did not accept the negation of the TTL field, it generated an error at the following rule:
alert ip any any -> any any (msg:"IP Time To Live Field Contain Unfamiliar Data... May Be Contain Covert Channel!"; ttl:!65; ip_proto:6; classtype:misc-activity; sid:21013232;)

While in Snort it is not possible to use the TTL word more than once per rule

The rule of negation can be defined in the Snort system as:
alert ip any any -> any any (msg:"IP Time To Live Field Contain Unfamiliar Data... May Be Contain Covert Channel!"; ttl:!64; ip_proto:6;  sid:2101321;)

But here we get the benefit only if the network traffic is permanently ttl=64

Likewise for TOS:
alert ip any any -> any any (msg:"Type of Service Field Contain Unfamiliar Data... May Be Contain Covert Channel!"; tos:!0; ip_proto:6; sid:2101322;)

It is not accepted more than once, and therefore we cannot benefit from it unless the TOS field in all network traffic is a uniform value

Using the TOS more than once is possible in Suricata:

alert ip any any -> any any (msg:"Type of Service Field Contain Unfamiliar Data... May Be Contain Covert Channel!"; tos:!0; tos:!1; tos:!2; tos:!4; tos:!8; ip_proto:6; classtype:misc-activity; sid:2101322;)

While it is not possible in the Snort system to use the word TOS more than once in each rule



------------------------- TIMING COVERT CHANNEL -----------------

The following rule is defined:
alert ip any any -> any any (msg:"Short IP Packet Detected"; dsize:<21; classtype:misc-activity; sid:10001010;)

The experiment was repeated under the same conditions, and the alert was issued:
02/13/2022-06:35:25.505567  [**] [1:10001010:0] Short IP Packet Detected [**] [Classification: Misc activity] [Priority: 3] {TCP} 192.168.18.178:80 -> 192.168.18.173:5000
